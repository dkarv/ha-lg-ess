# ha-lg-ess
HomeAssistant HACS integration for the LG ESS inverter.
Built with the Python library https://github.com/gluap/pyess (thanks!).

# Installation
Add _dkarv/ha-lg-ess_ as custom repository in HACS (in the three dots menu).

Then search for the integration or use the button below to install it:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dkarv&repository=ha-lg-ess)



## Setup

The integration can be configured easily through the UI after getting the password. It should be auto discovered, and only the password has to be entered.


You need the local device password, __which is not the account password__. Instead there are a few ways to get it:

1. Get the mac address of the lg ess and convert it. Mac address AA:BB:CC:DD:11:22 -> password aabbccdd1122
2. Extract it using the pyess library (it has a cli) __while connected to the devices WiFi__.
3. Do a post request, e.g. with curl __while connected to the devices WiFi__:
```
curl --insecure -H "Charset:UTF-8" -H "Content-Type:application/json" https://10.10.1.98/v1/user/setting/read/password -d '{"key": "lgepmsuser!@#}'
```


## Entities

All entities from the API are implemented.

Additionally, there is `batt_directional` and `grid_directional` (positive and negative value depending on the direction). This allows configuring various custom cards, e.g. https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus
```
type: custom:power-flow-card-plus
entities:
  battery:
    entity: sensor.lg_ess_batt_directional
    state_of_charge: sensor.lg_ess_statistics_bat_user_soc
  grid:
    entity: sensor.lg_ess_grid_directional
  solar:
    entity: sensor.lg_ess_statistics_pcs_pv_total_power
  home:
    entity: sensor.lg_ess_statistics_load_power
```
